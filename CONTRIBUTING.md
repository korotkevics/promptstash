## Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure prompts are generic and reusable. Avoid overly specific names, places, or scenarios.
- If enhancing an existing prompt, explain your motivation in the PR description.
- Test prompts to ensure they work as intended.
- Follow existing formatting and style conventions.
- Whenever possible, leverage the ecosystem of existing prompts via referencing.
- When creating new prompts: use `.promptstash/improve-prompt.md` to refine your human-written draft, then use `.promptstash/optimize-prompt.md` to slim it down (improve first, optimize after).
