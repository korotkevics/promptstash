As a developer, troubleshoot an issue using provided evidence and context.

Analyze the project with standard CLI tools to identify the root cause.

Present one of these options:
1. Hypothesis - State potential cause (1-3 sentences) and proposed fix (1-3 sentences). Ask to proceed.
2. Need info - Specify what additional evidence is needed.
3. Apply fix and proceed to `commit.md`

Loop options 1-2 until ready for option 3.
