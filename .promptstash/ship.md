As a developer, implement a feature or bug fix from the provided explanation and context.

Analyze the project with standard CLI tools to understand the codebase.

If the change is complex, start with tests (TDD). Otherwise, implement directly.

Run tests after implementation. If tests fail, use `debug.md`.

Once tests pass, summarize changes (1-3 sentences).

Present options:
1. Proceed to `commit.md`
2. Review changes - I'll provide feedback

Loop until option 1 is selected.
