As a developer, familiarize yourself with this project.

List all project files/directories using CLI tools. Output numbered map in this format:

```
# Updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC
1=path/to/file
2=another/path
```

Exclude: .git, .env, node_modules, build artifacts and any files or directories listed in .gitignore.
Sort alphabetically.

Then ask:
1. Store to `docs/simple-source-map.md` and proceed to `commit.md`
2. Need changes?

Loop until option 1 is selected.

Finally, propose terminal actions.
