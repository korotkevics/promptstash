# Issue Template Candidates - Comparison

Three GitHub issue template candidates have been created. Please review and select your preferred option.

## Candidate 1 - Minimal

**Philosophy:** Less is more. Keep it simple and let users provide what they need.

**Sections:**
- Description (required)
- Context (optional)

**Best for:** Quick issue creation, flexibility, minimal friction

**File:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/candidate-1-minimal.md`

---

## Candidate 2 - Structured

**Philosophy:** Guide users through clear sections that mirror good issue writing.

**Sections:**
- What (brief description)
- Why (motivation/problem)
- Details (context and notes)
- Examples (optional references)

**Best for:** Feature requests, ensuring proper justification, structured thinking

**File:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/candidate-2-structured.md`

---

## Candidate 3 - Workflow

**Philosophy:** Align with development workflow - current state vs. desired state.

**Sections:**
- Issue (description)
- Expected Outcome (what should happen)
- Current Behavior (optional - what happens now)
- Additional Context (optional details)

**Best for:** Bug reports, feature requests with clear goals, workflow alignment

**File:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/candidate-3-workflow.md`

---

## Recommendation

Based on the promptstash style (direct, workflow-focused, clear outcomes), **Candidate 3** aligns best with existing documentation patterns. However, if you prefer simplicity, **Candidate 1** offers minimal friction.

## Next Steps

Please comment with your selection:
- "Select candidate 1" for Minimal
- "Select candidate 2" for Structured  
- "Select candidate 3" for Workflow

The selected template will be promoted to `bug_report.md` or `issue.md`, unused candidates will be removed, and version will be bumped per `bump-semver-version.md`.
